# bfx-exchange-cmdline
A simple command line exchange. That simulates the exchange between distributed services.
The idea of this app service is to import different services to simulate the exchange interaction.
The interaction is logged to the command-line.

## TODOS
With more time add a command line utility to submit orders etc.
